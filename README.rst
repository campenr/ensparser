EnSParser 0.1a1
===============

Bugs and issue tracking
-----------------------

This script has not been tested against all output file permutations and
as such may incorrectly parse csv files output from certain protocols. Bug
reports should be submitted via the github issue tracker.

Description
-----------

This script was built in python 3, and may not operate correctly under python 2.

This script parses the csv output files generated by the Perkin Elmer EnSpire
2300 multi-label plate reader. The parser returns an iterator of the plate
data sets contained within an output file.

A plate data set is identified by the header text in the preceding row. The size
of the data set is automatically determined and the data set is extracted and
converted into a pandas DataFrame object with format: ::

      1       2       3       4       5       6       7
0
A  19106   18954   23140   21745   24585   22294   25033
B  18427  274628  285552  201486  245432  237888  232065
C  18618  228774   95715  116193  254504  161491  190138

Usage
-----

The ``parse_csv(file)`` function takes a csv file path as a string as it's only
argument. Handling of opening of the file is done within the function. To iterate
over a list of files, parse the data sets from those files, and save each data set
to a separate file (using pandas to_csv) for example: ::

  import enparser
  for file in list_of_files:
      data_sets = enparser.parse_csv(file)
      for index, data_set in enumerate(data_sets):
           with open("data_set_{number}.format(number=index), "w") as out_handle:
                data_set.to_csv(out_handle)
